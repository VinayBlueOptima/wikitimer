# Wiki Timer
A chrome extension to limit time browsing wikipedia, a deep rabbit hole for curious people.

## How to install
This is not a published extension yet, so follow the steps outlined below.
1. Clone this repo.
2. In chrome, open the extensions page by entering chrome://extensions in the url
   bar.
3. Enable developer mode, if not enabled already.
4. Load unpacked extension and pick the repo directory. You should see the
   browser action icon to the right of the url bar, which means the extension is loaded successfully.

## How it works
This extension works by observing user actions like opening, closing and switching tabs and keeps track of the time spent on
wikipedia sites. Once the time spent crosses the daily allotted limit, the extension redirects the user to a configured redirect 
page.
