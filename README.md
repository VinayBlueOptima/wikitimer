# Wiki Timer
A chrome extension to limit time browsing wikipedia, a deep rabbit hole for curious people.

## How it works
This extension works by observing user actions like opening, closing and switching tabs and keeps track of the time spent on
wikipedia sites. Once the time spent crosses the daily allotted limit, the extension redirects the user to a configured redirect 
page.
